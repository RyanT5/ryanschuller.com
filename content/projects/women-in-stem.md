[Edinburgh University Women in STEM Society](https://www.euwistem.com/) is focused on promoting equality in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. The society hopes to inspire and encourage students through meeting and engaging with a wide variety of successful individuals, allowing for networking and opportunities.
