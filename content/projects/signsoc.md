University of Edinburgh's Sign Language Society is dedicated to the teaching of introductory BSL, bringing awareness to Deaf culture and fundraising for Deaf Action, a local Deaf charity in Edinburgh.

You can support them and Deaf Action by donating to their [Sponsored Silence](https://www.gofundme.com/f/t8d7d-sponsored-silence).

I designed hoodies for them:
