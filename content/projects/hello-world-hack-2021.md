Hello World Hack is a beginner friendly hackathon organised by [Edinburgh University Women in STEM](https://www.euwistem.com/) and [Edinburgh University Programming Society](https://ediprogsoc.co.uk/). This year the hackathon was virtual due to Covid-19.

I designed the logo and merch for the event:
