Hello! I'm a Serverless Developer building event-driven cloud architectures at [aleios](https://aleios.com). Outside of that I also build web apps, design logos and craft user interfaces. If you're a recruiter looking for a quick overview then you can [check out my CV](/Ryan_Schuller_CV.pdf).

If you want to work together or just want to say hi then you can contact me at [ryanschuller@gmail.com](mailto:ryanschuller@gmail.com)
