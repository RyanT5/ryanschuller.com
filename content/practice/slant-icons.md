When MacOS Big Sur was announced at WWDC last month, I was very excited to see the design changes. One aspect I was not so keen on was the new app icons that came with it. The uniform shapes were nice but the aggressive use of shadows made them feel out of place amongst the flat design present in the rest of Apple's software.

To fix this I wanted to create an icon set that used the rounded-square shape and flat design from IOS, combined with the slant and gradient borders from MacOS Catalina.

Here is the result:

I don't claim any copyright over these icons since they are clearly derivatives of Apple and other companies.
